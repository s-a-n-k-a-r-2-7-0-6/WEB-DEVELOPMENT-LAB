</DT>
       <DD>    <P>Things known or assumed as facts, making the basis of reasoning or calculation.Data (US: /ˈdæˈtə/; UK: /ˈdeɪˈtə/) is individual facts, statistics, or items of information, often numeric. In a more technical sense, data are a set of values of qualitative or quantitative variables about one or more persons or objects, while a datum (singular of data) is a single value of a single variable.Although the terms "data" and "information" are often used interchangeably, this term has distinct meanings. In some popular publications, data are sometimes said to be transformed into information when they are viewed in context or in post-analysis.</P>

</DT>
       <DD><P>Data mining, also known as knowledge discovery in data (KDD), is the process of uncovering patterns and other valuable information from large data sets.Process of discovering patterns in large data sets using computational methods at the intersection of statistics, database systems, or machine learning.Data mining is a process of extracting and discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of machine learning, statistics, and database systems. Data mining is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and statistics with an overall goal to extract information.</P></DD>

       <DD><P>Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. Specific applications of AI include expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition and machine vision.All but the simplest human behaviour is ascribed to intelligence, while even the most complicated insect behaviour is never taken as an indication of intelligence. What is the difference? Consider the behaviour of the digger wasp, Sphex ichneumoneus. When the female wasp returns to her burrow .</P></DD>

</DT>
       <DD>    <P>Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that can improve automatically through experience and by the use of data. It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence.Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that can improve automatically through experience and by the use of data. It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data, in order to make predictions</P>

</DT>
       <DD>    <P>Data analysis is a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modelling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making.The data analytics process has some components that can help a variety of initiatives. By combining these components, a successful data analytics initiative will provide a clear picture of where you are, where you have been and where you should go.

</DT>
       <DD>    <P>In computing, a data warehouse, also known as an enterprise data warehouse, is a system used for reporting and data analysis and is considered a core component of business intelligence.A data warehouse is a type of data management system that is designed to enable and support business intelligence (BI) activities, especially analytics. Data warehouses are solely intended to perform queries and analysis and often contain large amounts of historical data.</P>
