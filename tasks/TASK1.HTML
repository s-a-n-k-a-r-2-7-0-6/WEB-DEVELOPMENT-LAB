        <p><font color=RED>INTRODUCION TO WEB DESINGING:
        Web design is the planning and creation of websites. This includes a number of separate skills that all fall under the umbrella of web design.

Some examples of these skills are information architecture, user interface, site structure, navigation, layout, colors, fonts, and overall imagery. All of these skills are combined with the principles of design to create a website that meets the goals of the company or individual from whom that site is being created.
        Design, obviously, is a key part of "web design." What does this mean exactly? Design includes both the principles of design — balance, contrast, emphasis, rhythm, and unity — and the design elements — lines, shapes, texture, color, and direction.
